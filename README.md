Credit default prediction is central to managing risk in a consumer lending business. Credit default prediction allows lenders to optimize lending decisions, which leads to a better customer experience and sound business economics. Current models exist to help manage risk. But it's possible to create better models that can outperform those currently in use.

American Express is a globally integrated payments company. The largest payment card issuer in the world, they provide customers with access to products, insights, and experiences that enrich lives and build business success.

In this project, I have applied machine learning skills to predict credit default. Different feature engineering techniques, data pre processing techniques, ML models were used to solve this problem. Training, validation, and testing datasets include time-series behavioral data and anonymized customer profile information.
